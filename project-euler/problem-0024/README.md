Originally used brute force algorithm defined on Wikipedia to determine the Nth [permutation in lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Generation_in_lexicographic_order)

Final algorithm uses [factorial number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system) to calculate the Nth permutation in O(1) time.  This algorithm is also more clearly explained here: [http://irenes-coding-blog.blogspot.com/2012/07/factorial-base-numbers-and-permutations.html]()
